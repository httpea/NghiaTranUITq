# Flight Visualization 
An crazy experiement for demonstrating visulazation. The millions flight data from Keegle.

## Technologies
- Mapbox is perfect choice for rendering vector-base map.
- I intend to use Deck.gl to visualize million flight data, all of them are rendered by OpenGL. So the performances are really good.
- Heatmap overlay
